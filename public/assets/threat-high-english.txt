We’ve got confirmation that the supply drop arrived at the forward position. How’s the status on their distribution?

Still in progress. Fuel reserves are accounted for, but the ammunition inventory is delayed. Logistics is moving slower than expected due to weather.

Understood. Prioritize readiness at all locations. What’s the morale report from the northern group?

Mixed. They’re fatigued, but operational. Reports of minor desertions, but it hasn’t impacted unit cohesion yet.

Alright. Make sure there’s no chatter about that—it stays internal. Shift their attention to tactical preparations for the coming maneuvers.

Do you mean maneuvers as in training exercises, or are we looking at something more specific?

Training exercises, officially. However, inform the officers privately to increase readiness. This isn’t a drill.

Acknowledged. Recon assets have reported movement to the west. Should we reposition, or stay focused on the central approach?

Hold current positions. Reinforcements will arrive within 48 hours, and we’ll use that window to consolidate. Is the heavy equipment operational?

Mostly. A few vehicles need servicing, but they’re functional enough for short-term action. Engineers are working overtime to bring them to full capacity.

Good. The diversion unit is already en route, correct?

Yes, and they’ll reach the staging area by 0300 hours. After that, we can initiate Phase One.

Phase One? Are we escalating this?

Correct. The order came down. Phase One begins with coordinated artillery strikes on their defensive positions, specifically the ridge at grid 14-22.

Copy that. And Phase Two?

Phase Two depends on their response. If their lines collapse, the armored columns will push through directly to the bridgehead. If not, we switch to attritional tactics and draw their forces into the open.

Do we have air support confirmed?

Limited. We’ll have two sorties for suppression, but they’re stretched thin across other sectors. The ground units will carry the weight.

Understood. I’ll notify the officers to prepare for a rapid advance after the artillery phase. Anything else?

Yes, remind them that comms discipline is critical. No transmissions that could compromise timing or location. The Ukrainians have been intercepting too much recently.

Noted. I’ll pass that along. Is there a fallback plan if this doesn’t go as expected?

Fallback plan is simple: hold the current line at all costs. Reinforcements won’t be immediate, so it’s critical we gain ground quickly.

Understood. I’ll make sure everything is ready. Anything else before I move out?

No, that’s all. Just ensure we hit hard and fast. Timing is everything.

Got it. We’ll be ready.
